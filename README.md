# FirstProjectNodeJS
This project has the goal to start practice and study the NodeJS language. The application is based on keeping records contained in a file using a scricp with endpoint. The extension used to access the endpoints in the script is called Restclient. To keep the application always running, the Nodemon extension was used.
